# NST DVA Capstone 2 - Project Repository

Newton School of Technology | Data Visualization & Analytics  
A 2-week industry simulation capstone using Python, GitHub, and Tableau to convert raw data into actionable business intelligence.

## Before You Start

- Rename the repository using the format `SectionName_TeamID_ProjectName`.
- Fill in the project details and team table below.
- Add the raw dataset to `data/raw/`.
- Complete the notebooks in order from `01` to `05`.
- Publish the final dashboard and add the public link in `tableau/dashboard_links.md`.
- Export the final report and presentation as PDFs into `reports/`.

## Quick Start

If you are working locally:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

If you are working in Google Colab:

## Business Problem

Hospitals often struggle to identify which diabetic patients are most likely to be readmitted within 30 days after discharge. This project uses historical U.S. hospital encounter data to identify the strongest factors associated with short-term readmission. The analysis supports hospital operations teams in prioritizing follow-up and discharge planning for high-risk segments.

### Core Business Question

Which patient and encounter patterns best indicate 30-day readmission risk for diabetic patients?

### Decision Supported

This analysis supports targeted intervention decisions, including risk-tiered discharge plans and early post-discharge follow-up.

## Dataset

| Attribute | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Source Name | UCI Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset |
| Direct Access Link | [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008) |
| Row Count | 101,766 |
| Column Count | 50 raw columns (17 cleaned columns used in analysis) |
| Time Period Covered | 1999 to 2008 |
| Format | CSV |

### Key Columns Used

| Column Name | Description | Role in Analysis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `age` | Patient age group | Segmentation and dashboard filter |
| `admission_type` | Decoded admission type | Driver analysis and filter |
| `time_in_hospital` | Number of stay days | KPI and statistical testing |
| `num_medications` | Medication count | Treatment complexity signal |
| `number_emergency` | Prior emergency visits | High-risk segmentation |
| `number_inpatient` | Prior inpatient visits | High-risk segmentation |
| `insulin` | Insulin status | Treatment pattern comparison |
| `readmitted_30` | 30-day readmission flag | Primary target variable |

For full column definitions, see `data/data_dictionary.md`.

## KPI Framework

| KPI | Definition | Formula / Computation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 30-day Readmission Rate | % of encounters readmitted within 30 days | `mean(readmitted_30) * 100` |
| Average Length of Stay | Average days admitted | `mean(time_in_hospital)` |
| Average Medication Count | Average medication load | `mean(num_medications)` |
| Readmission by Prior Inpatient Group | Segment risk by prior inpatient usage | `groupby(prior_inpatient_group).mean(readmitted_30)` |
| Readmission by Prior Emergency Group | Segment risk by prior emergency usage | `groupby(prior_emergency_group).mean(readmitted_30)` |

Document KPI logic clearly in `notebooks/04_statistical_analysis.ipynb` and `notebooks/05_final_load_prep.ipynb`.

## Tableau Dashboard

| Item | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Dashboard URL | Paste Tableau Public link in `tableau/dashboard_links.md` |
| Executive View | KPI summary and readmission distribution |
| Operational View | Segment drill-down by utilization and treatment factors |
| Main Filters | Age group, gender, race, admission type, insulin status |

Store dashboard screenshots in `tableau/screenshots/` and document the public links in `tableau/dashboard_links.md`.

## Key Insights

1. 30-day readmission rate is approximately 11.16%.
2. Prior inpatient history is the strongest risk signal.
3. Prior emergency history also materially increases risk.
4. Longer hospital stays show higher readmission tendency.
5. Higher medication burden aligns with elevated readmission risk.
6. Insulin status groups show measurable risk variation.
7. Admission type contributes to meaningful readmission segmentation.
8. Readmission risk is concentrated in specific subgroups, enabling targeted interventions.

## Recommendations

| # | Insight | Recommendation | Expected Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Prior inpatient risk concentration | Introduce risk-tiered discharge checklist for high-utilization patients | Reduced avoidable 30-day readmissions |
| 2 | Prior emergency segment risk | Trigger mandatory early follow-up for high emergency-history patients | Better continuity of care |
| 3 | Medication burden signal | Add focused medication reconciliation before discharge | Lower medication-related returns |
| 4 | Non-uniform risk across segments | Prioritize care coordination resources to top-risk groups | Improved intervention ROI |
